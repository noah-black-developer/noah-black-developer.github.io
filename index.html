                    Profressionally, I am a full-time Software Engineer with a heavy focus on DevOps, automation, and a deep knowledge of software.
                    I've worn many hats over the years - test engineer, developer, project architect, and more - and I take pride in being adaptive to new problem spaces.

                    Nothing is more interesting to me than a problem that needs solving; nothing is more satisfying to me than solving it in a way that is designed to last.

                    Personally, I try to fill my life with as much art and creativity as I can!
                    I'm an avid fantasy fan; between running D&D games, cosplay, and even amatuer chainmaille work (emphasis on amatuer), I make sure to keep myself busy. If you're ever at the Maryland Ren Faire, keep an eye out for some of my antics! 
                </span>
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>
                    I have a life-long love of music, theater, lifting, and puzzles, but I'm always seeking out new hobbies to take on.
                    If anything I listed resonated with you, I may just be your guy!

                    This page was designed as an experiment with building a website one piece of tech at a time, going from HTML to CSS to JavaScript.
                    While modern web frameworks are powerful and brilliant at what they do, I was interested in getting a better understanding of
                    the inner workings of a webpage and better inform my usage of those frameworks in the future.

                    I figure, well, since it was a bit of a deep-dive into the simpler days of the web, it only felt right to style the whole page as such.
                    Which got us here - to a (hopefully) faithful recreation of the Apple II terminal screen!
